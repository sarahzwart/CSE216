# Description of Functionality

The app will allow an admin to create and delete tables and delete other's posts and comments. Admin also has access to all of the user's information that is collected when an account is created. Anonymous users (all marked with the same user ID for tracking purposes) will then be able to comment on them. Along with this, a mobile app will allow for the same functionalities, but on the emulator used in the tutorials. Likes are also set up in the backend

# Missing Functionality

OAuth account creation and access isn't functional, so as of now only anonymous users are able to post, vote, and comment. Upvotes and downvotes are not currently functional in the web and mobile frontends. Also, comments are not functional in the mobile branch

# Instructions on Running Locally

Start dokku server using instructions in dokku.md in backend folder. To start web, run the deploy.sh file in the web folder. For mobile, launch mobile emulator in VS Code and then start debugging on main.dart in VS Code.
