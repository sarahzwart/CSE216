## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
* The PM submitted the report.
2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
* Yes, after class and whenever necessary.
3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
* We met the requirements of the sprint by following the rubric’s guidelines and using Trello to manage everything. The sprint as a whole went smoothly. Aiden added new features into the Mobile UI and the backlog. Kamil gave the two System State diagrams a much needed polish. Sarah added new routes, and Ashley added the User Stories. Finally, I added in the Unit Testing procedure. Design of the app is subject to change with time, however I feel we can get close to what we desire. Work was balanced across all members of the team, and completed in a timely manner without delay.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
* The Status of each member’s progress and each artifact is complete to a satisfactory level. However, previous items in the backlog remain incomplete, Oauth is having difficulty on Web and Mobile, and Dislikes are a bit broken right now. These issues will be addressed over the course of the week.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
* From last week, not much new code was written, however we have a good idea of what needs to be done. Ashley expressed interest in cleaning up the many lines of code in the Backend, Aiden wants to change up the build version of Web deploy, Kamil wants to add more pages, and Sarah wants to make the Admin code more understandable. These desires came up during our in-person group meeting, which served the purpose of a code review and task delegation. 

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
* Phase Activities I encouraged to be done in a low stress, leisurely way so that it could be done right.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
* Together, we shared details of what should be done and used that to build the entities listed in the rubric.

8. How well is the team communicating?
* The team is communicating very well; conversations are loose but we can still focus on our tasks. We aren’t afraid to bring up problems we are having and are supportive when the issues are resolved. I feel our dynamic is ideal, as we come from different backgrounds and speak as equals. We all acknowledge that no matter what our entities and code will never be perfect but we manage to make it through. We communicate frequently and clearly, and work efficiently as expected.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
* The expectations we have set for each other is that we all communicate frequently within reason, and that we make a fair attempt to complete all tasks even if we aren’t able to complete them. We meet often, if anyone has a prior arrangement and can’t make the meeting it is always dictated to the rest of the team. We always share and show our work, as is expected.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.
* Challenge: Developing Oauth in Backend 
 * Description: Issues arose in getting Oauth to work on the web and mobile branches. This was a problem that involved every part of the project, with many factors coming in from all sides. 
 * Status: unresolved 
 * Critical Steps: We are still unresolved, but the first step was to fix up our backend such that we could save the new users and gather all the required information for web and mobile to get a better picture of what to do. The issue will be resolved soon.

## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
* We met with our mentor on Thursday for about 30min.

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
* I feel that enough detail was added, however for the next sprint, since things will be more complicated, I will need to add in more.

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
* Team meetings were conducted fairly casually. It’s no fun being ordered around, but with the trello board everyone knew what exactly their responsibilities were so we didn’t neet to get that serious with each other. Outside our meetings we act similarly.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
* Bi-daily meetings are what we generally use. Risk is also usually low, and we don’t need to change our formula unless something drastic happens.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
* Interacting with my team mates is pleasent, we are constructive since we are all on the same boat trying to figure things out together.

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
* My concerns lie in getting caching to work, but that’s mostly because it’s a new topic for a new backend manager.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
* The most significant obstacle we have faced is a monster named Oauth.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
* There won’t be another PM. However, a next PM should add more detail to trello and potentially stop waiting for updates and simply ask for them.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
* We estimated the time well; we got our video done and the PM report done early too.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
* The aspect that concerns me is getting caching and Oauth finished at the same time may detract from both goals.
