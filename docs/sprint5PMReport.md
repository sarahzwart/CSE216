## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 

    Yes, I, Kamil Gjondla, am submitting this report.

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?

    Yes, we gathered for our weekly meeting with Ala, our mentor. We did this at our usual weekly meeting time, Thursday at 5PM.

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * We worked did a good job working on this sprint. All of us participated in making the diagrams that were required of us.
    * The design of our app is pretty basic so far. It includes a forum-like web/mobile app that allows anonymous users to like messages. It also allows administrators of the app to create posts. We have not gotten to the implementation yet, as that is something we will be working on in the next sprint.
    * As a whole, everyone did really well starting on/working on the sprint during our team meeting. This was a good, early start for us all. However, after that, everyone started pushing off the rest of the work that needed to be done. This resulted in us all having to finish the sprint in a time crunch on the day it was due. In the future, this is something we need to work on.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * Aidan: Aidan completed the design diagrams that were expected of him. He asked if I could use my backend code in the git repo, since he is not sure if his works correctly. Overall, his section is completed.
    * Ashley: Ashley also completed the design diagrams that were expected of her. She also added her admin files to the git repo. Overall, her section is completed.
    * Nick: Nick also completed the design diagrams that were expected of him. He also added his web files to the git repo. Overall, his section is completed.
    * Sarah: Sarah also completed  the design diagrams that were expected of her. She also added her mobile files to the git repo. Overall, her section is completed.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Throughout the sprint, I was periodically checking on the git repo on bitbucket to track the progress everyone was making. Along with this, on Sunday before we submitted our assignment, we went through each branch and went through the files and code to make sure everything was satisfactory.

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * I made everything they needed to continue working, such as the git repo and trello board, to get them to start working earlier. Along with this, we were in communication with each other, trying to get each other to work on the assignment before the due date.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * I asked some of the team members to work on some of the diagrams together in order to finish it a little faster. This was especially useful in diagrams that required input from backend, web, mobile, and admin, such as the one about tests.

8. How well is the team communicating?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Our team is communicating well. We bounce between Slack and a group chat frequently, so even when it looks like we aren't communicating in Slack, we are probably texting each other. Overall, communication is not a big issue.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * We set expectations that each of us would communicate when needed and that we would all attend the team meetings. Along with this, for this phase specifically, we set expectations that bottleneck features would be completed early so that they do not hold back the work of others.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Challenge: Bitbucket was not allowing more than 5 people in the workspace
        * Status: resolved
        * Description: For some reason, my bitbucket account was still using the free version even through I was approved for the academic license.
        * Critical steps taken to find resolution: I talked with my team and did some troubleshooting myself. Eventually, I reapplied for the academic license and, after they got back to me with it, the workspace was upgraded to the academic plan.


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?

    * We met with our mentor at our usual Thursday 5PM time. We met for about 45 minutes, since we had more questions for Ala than usual.

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?

    * I think We had a good amount of detail in Trello. We made cards for each requirement of the sprint. As for the policies, I allowed anyone to edit the Trello board in case they had anything they wanted to add/remove. We have enough trust between each other to know that no one will ruin all the work we did.

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?

    * For team meetings, we all just worked on our individual tasks and asked for help if we needed it. Outside of meetings, we just texted/used Slack whenever we needed to communicate with each other.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.

    * I did not change much from last week. We don't seem to be having any major problems, so I didn't change a lot. This week, I might try to get the team members to start work a little early. Other than that, I think we are working pretty well.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?

    * We did not have any sort of team issues arise. I believe what is keeping things constructive is that no one wants to be the person that lets everyone else down. We all trust each other to do the work required, and no one wants to break that trust.

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?

    * My biggest concern is that some team members will not get their work done early. That is something I hope we can work on.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.

    * The only major difficulty we faced was the problem with bitbucket. Sarah and the professor could not get into the repo. To solve this, I just had Sarah send me everything she was going to add to the repo and I added it myself.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * I would suggest the next PM tries to get the group to start encouraging members to work on the project over time instead of all in one go.
    * I would suggest the next PM tries to get the group to stop finishing the assignments on the due date, and try to finish it early.
    * I would suggest to continue the open communication between each other and the problems we are having.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?

    * I estimated the time decently well. The work itself took a little longer than I estimated. I did not think the sprint would take very long, as it is just the design phase and the bulk of the work would just be creating the diagrams. However, I did not account for the issues with bitbucket, which I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?

    * Right now, the project is definitely not ready to ship out. There are a lot of issues with the project that don't allow it to work. In this next sprint, hopefully, all of these will be resolved and extra functionality will be added.
